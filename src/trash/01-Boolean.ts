/*
 * INTRODUCTION:
 *
 * A Domain Specific Language (DSL) is a way to solve a complex domain problem by combining simple solutions together.
 * Basically it means that, by combining a few tiny pieces together, you can accomplish very big things.
 *
 * A DSL is composed of three parts:
 * - The model:    The data structure supporting the DSL
 * - Constructors: A set of fundamental solutions to the problem domain solved by the DSL
 * - Operators:    A set of operations that allow the transformation or combination of simple
 * 								 solutions to solve more complex problems
 *
 * Sounds complicated but, a DSL is actually nothing that specialâ€¦ And you're using many every day!
 * For example, one of the most powerful DSLs you've been using all your life is number.
 *
 * You can construct simple solutions:
 * `const number = 1`
 *
 * You can operate on these solutions to solve more complex problems:
 * `const complex = 1 * 2 / 3 + 4
 *
 * Let's create a tiny `Decision` DSL to get a feel for what a DSL is made of.
 *
 * @note: This whole series will only talk about *embedded* DSLs, AKA DSL implemented within a host language, as opposed to
 * an *external* DSL that would have its own interpreter.
 */

/**
 * Exercise 01:
 *
 * Let's start with the model, the model is how you encode things under the hood.
 *
 * Here, we need a representation that allows us to express the binary nature of a decision, it is either `yes` or `no`, otherwise it's not a decision.
 *
 * @worksheet: Create an encoding for our `Decision` DSL

namespace Exercise01 {
	type Decision = never

namespace Exercise01Solution {
	class Yes {
		readonly _tag = "yes"
	}

	class No {
		readonly _tag = "No"
	}

	type Decision = Yes | No
}
// @solution-end

/**
 * Exercise 02:
 *
 * Next, we need a way to create members of the DSL, those are called constructors.
 *
 * A constructor might take a value of some kind and returns a member of the DSL (here, a `Decision`):
 *
 * @worksheet: Create constructor for a `Yes` and a constructor for a `No` (depending on which encoding you chose, you might already have that)
 *
 * @worksheet: Let's be honest, a Decision looks a lot like a boolean, let's create a constructor allowing to create a `Decision` from a boolean
 *
 * @worksheet: Talking about boolean, how many constructors can you think of for a boolean?
 *
 * @solution: No matter how you choose to encode it, at the end of the day, a boolean expresses a binary state of either `Yes` or, `No`,
 * 						so we need a way to construct each one. Javascript has native keywords for this:
 * 	  				-	`true`
 *    				-	`false`
 * 					  We probably also need some interop with other data types like number and strings. Again, javascript has native keywords for this:
 * 					  - `===`, `===`, `!==`, `!=` (From equality)
 * 					  - `>` `<` v>=` `<=` `===` (From order)
 * 					  Technically we could derive equality from order but, we are getting a bit too abstract.
 * 					  We could also have a `fromValue` thing, taking a `String`, an `Array`, ... and returning a boolean depending on established rules.
