/*
 * INTRODUCTION:
 *
 * A Domain Specific Language (DSL) is a way to solve a complex domain problem by combining simple solutions together.
 * Basically it means that, by combining a few tiny pieces together, you can accomplish very big things.
 *
 * The domain might be a technical domain like building a pipeline, handling asynchronous data, validation, ...
 * or a more business oriented domain like a rule engine for insurance eligibility, AB testing/user segmentation,
 * email triaging rules, ...
 *
 * A DSL is composed of three parts:
 * - The model:    The data structure supporting the DSL
 * - Constructors: A set of fundamental solutions to the problem domain solved by the DSL
 * - Operators:    A set of operations that allow the transformation or combination of simple
 * 								 solutions to solve more complex problems
 *
 * Sounds complicated but, a DSL is actually nothing that specialâ€¦ And you've been using many every day!
 * For example, one of the most powerful DSLs you've been using all your life is maths.
 *
 * The underlying model is `number`
 *
 * You can construct simple solutions:
 * `const one = 1`
 *
 * You can combine these simple solutions together to solve more complex problems:
 * `const complex = 1 * 2 / 3 + 4
 *
 * A good sign you're dealing with a DSL is recursivity, everytime you operate on a member of the DSL, you get back a new member of the DSL
 * ```
 * const someNumber: number = 1
 * const transformedNumber: number = 3 / 2 + 1
 * ```
 *
 * Okay, enough theory for now, let's get our hands on a few DSL to get a feel for what it looks like, what it can do and, maybe,
 * start recognizing a few patterns before creating our owns.
 *
 *
 * @note: This series assumes you understand currying, function composition and, how to use the `pipe` operator.
 *
 * @note: This whole series will only talk about *embedded* DSLs, AKA DSL implemented within a host language, as opposed to
 * an *external* DSL that would have its own interpreter.

/**
 * Example 1: Inbox overload!
 *
 * We are the leading service in package shipping but our reputation has started to take a dive the past few months,
 * our customer service team is buried under an avalanche of emails, urgent shipping requests get lost in the mix,
 * response times lag, and everyone feels overwhelmed.
 *
 * We need a way to streamline their workflow and bring back order to our customer service.
 *
 * Thankfully, the dev team has crafted a custom DSL to facilitate the creation of triaging rules for
 * the thousands of support requests we receive every day.
 *
 * Until the UI is ready, as the head of the CS team, use this DSL to implement the urgent classifications the team has asked for.
 *
 * @meta: This is a more business oriented DSL, while the source is regular code, it is meant to be handled
 * 				by stakeholders through a UI.
 *
 * @meta: This DSL is incomplete, technically we only have the matching/tagging DSL here (does a request match an inbox),
 * 				but we have no notion of what inbox/team the request should be sent to/which inbox to prioritize to
 * 				when two filters are matching a request.

/**
 * Example 03:
 *
 * Our company's recent growth has been amazing!  New clients keep coming on board,
 * and we're constantly pushing out updates and features to keep them happy.
 *
 * However, our current deployment pipeline is becoming a bit of a roadblock, as we take on new clients and features,
 * the deployment scenarios get more complex, and the YAML struggles to keep up. Additionally, the YAML syntax has proven
 * difficult to understand and maintain, which slows everything down.
 *
 * This ultimately means it takes longer to get new features out the door.
 *
 * The team has designed a pipeline DSL that will allow us to ditch the cryptic YAML syntax for familiar TypeScript.
 * The DSL provides the tools we need to write clear and concise pipelines, even for complex deployments and,
 * since we already know TypeScript, writing, understanding, and maintaining deployment pipelines should become a breeze.
