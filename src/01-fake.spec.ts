 * END
 *
 * In this section we have seen that a DSL is made of

 * - Constructors
 * - Operators
 *
 * We have covered the 4 main operators (and more) that you will need in pretty much any DSL you'll write
 * - map
 * - zip
 * - chain
 * - orElse
 *
 * At the end of the day, the usefulness of a DSL is very much limited by the combined power of its constructors and operators.
 *
 * For example, without the `chain` operator our DSL would be quite useless.
 * It also wouldn't be much better if it had a `chain` operator but no `int` generator.
 *
 * We've stopped here, but you can have some fun and re-implement every constructor in the whole faker library,
